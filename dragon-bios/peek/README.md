# Peek
Another simple layout. This time with a little sidebar on the left.

There are two variations available. One with a section for outfit/gene plans and pricing notes. The other instead has a decorative familiar and a bulleted lore overview in this section.

Vertical sidebars are available in [this thread](https://www1.flightrising.com/forums/gde/3269012), and the one it links to!

**Includes**
- name
- title/caption
- pronouns
- a couple of info fields (either pricing or lore)
- a small area to write whatever
- a decorative sidebar (that can be removed if wanted)
- spot for a 200x200 decorative image or a scrying workshop/dressing room widget
