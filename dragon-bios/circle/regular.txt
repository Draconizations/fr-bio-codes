[center]Try to write enough here so the text wraps around and the other column gets pushed all the way to the side. Even if you have to fill it up with absolute nonsense. Banana apricot peach apple cherry pomegranate lime lemon blueberries raspberries grapes blackberries. Can you tell i like fruit. Pineapple dragonfruit lychee mango papaya tomato strawberry passionfruit nectarine

oh god I have to write more now. This is horrible. Whatever shall I do. I don't know more fruit to list here. Did you know that I discovered flight rising through one of those how to draw dragon books? Yeah turns out Undel made some of those. It had a link to this site. I also had another how to draw dragons book by Christopher Hart and if you know anything about Christopher Hart you know how terrible that book could've been. It was pretty terrible. The proposed dragon anatomy sucked so bad it made teen me so angry I had to draw anatomy that actually made sense. Good god.[/center]
