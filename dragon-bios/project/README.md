# Dashed
A minimalist template for gene projects

**Includes**
- project/dragon name
- genes needed
- skin needed
- apparel needed
- a simple way to track which ones you have already
  - just swap out the empty sparkles for filled out ones!

## Tips & Tricks
### Symbols used
- for if you happen to lose any of them
- ✦ *(owned)*
- ✧ *(needed)*
- ⊘ *(n/a)*

### Spacing
- I typically try to center the second column by adding some newlines to the top of the column
- this is personal preference and you don't need to do this!

### Apparel IDs
- this template relies on the `[gamedb item=1234]` formatting for apparel.
- getting all of those IDs via the database might be tedious!
- BUT if you have an outfit saved, grab the image's URL
- look for the section of the URL that starts with `&apparel=`, this is a comma separated list of all the IDs, in the order of which the apparel is applied
- just copy and paste those!

### Gene DB links
- the current template uses links instead of gamedb formatting for genes
- this is a personal preference (some gene names are very lenghty). you can replace them with the gamedb item fine
- if getting the gene IDs is too much effort, removing the links is also a perfectly viable option :P
